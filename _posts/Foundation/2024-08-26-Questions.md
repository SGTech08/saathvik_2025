# Version Control
## During the setup process, I've gained insights into how version control operates in the development workflow.

- **How are the files from GitHub placed on your local machine? How do you navigate to those files?**

  Files from GitHub are transferred to my local machine using the `git clone` command, which copies the repository files to my local system. To navigate these files, I can either use Visual Studio Code (VSCode) by clicking through the file explorer or by using the `cd` command in the terminal.

- **How are the files upddwated in GitHub? How do you navigate to those files?**

  Files are updated on GitHub by making changes locally, then committing and pushing those changes back to the repository. This is done using commands like `git commit` and `git push`. I can view these changes by visiting the GitHub repository and browsing through the files.

- **How would you update your template of the portfolio_2025 repository? How would you make it more applicable to your specific course?**

  I could enhance the template by adding a personal timeline that tracks our weekly activities in class, similar to the weekly tables used in CSP. Additionally, I could include Java hacks and learning content that aligns with the future coursework in Java.

# Localhost vs. Deployed Server
## Describing the difference between viewing GitHub Pages on your localhost versus on a deployed server.

The key difference is that localhost runs on my local machine, meaning only I can see it. In contrast, a deployed server is accessible to anyone with the URL.

- **What is the localhost URL for your project? Can anyone else see what you see?**

  The localhost URL for my project is `http://127.0.0.1:4100/student_2025/devops/hacks`. This URL is only accessible from my machine, so no one else can see what I see unless they are physically using my computer.

- **What is the GitHub Pages URL for your project? Can anyone else see what you see?**

  The GitHub Pages URL for my project is `https://sris126.github.io/Sri2025/`. Anyone with this URL can view the project as I see it.

# DNS and GitHub Pages
## Reflecting on DNS and its role in GitHub Pages.

- **Is there a domain on your GitHub Pages?**

  Yes, GitHub Pages provides a domain, specifically a subdomain in the form of `github.io`.

- **Is the URL for your GitHub Pages different from your neighborsâ€™ URLs? Did you change the URL? If so, when?**

  Yes, the URLs are different because they are based on the repository name and the username. I modified the URL to include "Sri2025" to personalize it.
