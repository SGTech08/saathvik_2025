With a deep appreciation for education, I enjoy challenging myself academically, often taking on rigorous coursework to push my limits and expand my knowledge. Outside the classroom, I have a passion for collecting shoes, finding joy in the unique designs and cultural significance each pair holds. In my free time, I unwind by playing video games, with Fortnite being my favorite, as it combines strategy and creativity in a way that resonates with me. My ultimate goal is to become a software engineer, a career path that aligns with my love for problem-solving and technology. Iâ€™ve also achieved significant recognition in DECA, where I earned 1st Place at both the state and district levels in Southern California, and qualified for the International Career Development Conference (ICDC) in my first year of competition.
